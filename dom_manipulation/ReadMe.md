# Web Development Fundamentals

## General Objectives

### 1. Understand the Document Object Model (DOM)

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a fundamental concept in web development that serves as a bridge between web pages and JavaScript. It allows developers to interact with and manipulate the content and structure of a webpage in real-time.

### 2. Access and Manipulate Elements with JavaScript

Developers should acquire the skills to access and manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript. This includes tasks such as changing text within a paragraph, updating images, and altering the style of elements, enabling dynamic changes to web pages.

### 3. Use CSS Selectors and Traverse the DOM Tree

Proficiency in using CSS selectors to target specific HTML elements within a web page is essential. Additionally, understanding how to traverse the DOM tree facilitates navigation between elements, their parents, and children, aiding in precise targeting for modification or interaction.

### 4. Work with Event Listeners/Handlers

Interactive web applications require event handling. Developers should learn to capture user interactions like clicks and keystrokes and respond to them using event listeners and handlers. This skill is crucial for building engaging and responsive web experiences.
