# ALX Intro To Software Engineering Cohort 00 20hrs             JavaScript Closures and Scoping

## Learning Objectives

In this project, you will explore key concepts related to JavaScript closures and scoping. By the end of this project, you will have a better understanding of the following topics:

1. **Lexical Scoping in JavaScript:** Learn how JavaScript manages variable scope based on where variables are declared in your code.

2. **Closures in JavaScript:** Understand what closures are, how they work, and their significance in JavaScript.

3. **Using Closures:** Learn how to create and use closures effectively in your code.

4. **Chaining Different Closures:** Explore how to compose and chain multiple closures together to achieve complex behaviors.

5. **Simulating Private Methods with Closure:** Discover how closures can be used to encapsulate and simulate private methods in JavaScript.

6. **Execution Stack Order in JavaScript:** Understand the order in which functions are executed in JavaScript, including the concept of the call stack.

7. **Binding in JavaScript:** Learn about binding and how it affects the value of `this` within functions.

8. **Using Callbacks:** Explore the use of callbacks in asynchronous JavaScript programming.

## Requirements

To get the most out of this project, you will need the following:

- **Recommended Editors:** Visual Studio Code (or any code editor of your choice).

- **File Extensions:** Ensure that all your JavaScript files use the `.js` extension.

- **New Line Endings:** All your files should end with a new line to maintain code readability.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply create JavaScript files for each topic you wish to explore. You can organize your code into separate files or use a single file for demonstration purposes. Experiment with closures, scoping, and other concepts as you go through the learning objectives.

Feel free to document your code, create examples, and include comments to clarify your understanding of these concepts. You can also use the provided README.md file to document your progress and findings.
